Hi, this is my homework #1 source code package.

The bin folder contains all .class file that generated by eclipse.

The src folder contains all .java source code file

The clueweb09_wikipedia_15p_invLists folder contains all inverted list. Both .inv and .tilte.inv. It is necessary for running the program.
This folder¡¯s position can be changed at the beginning part of main.java in src folder. There is comment to point out corresponding statement.

The result of program will output to output.txt in the root folder.
This file¡¯s position can also be changed at the beginning part of main.java is src folder. There is comment to point out corresponding statement.

The resultSet folder contains more experiment result for review. It contains all BOW-OR/BOW-AND/Structured query, ranked/unranked approach¡¯s retrieval results and analysis results.

The default input file is the Structured-input.txt in this folder. The input file path can be changed at the beginning part of main.java in src folder.

The stoplist.txt store all the stopwords.


Hope my program will run properly and provide satisfied result. If there is any problem with it, please feel free to contact any time(24x7 ^_^).
